## Not sure what to contribute? BASEDEF.

### Blog
When you stumble upon a project written by someone else (your coworker, say) you tend to see a clear high-level overview and this makes you the perfect person to write an introductory blog post explaining the project. 

### Apply
The best thing for a new tool is to be put to use. Apply a project to one of your own.

### Suggest
Follow a projectâ€™s documentation and see if you can achieve a small victory in less than 5 minutes. Tell the maintainer how it went & what was confusing. 

### Extend
Add a new feature, either of your own invention or inspired by a feature request on github.

### Document
Write a separate set of documents or improve error messaging. Skews toward technical writing. 

### Evangelize
Email it, tweet it, submit it to other publications. Just make sure to check with the maintainer, they may prefer to fix problems before recruiting users. 

### Fix
Fix specific bugs or improve the general process of project development. Includes adding a test suite, enabling continuous integration, or using static code analyzers.
